When I was in high school, my friends would recommend music to me. But they didn't stop there; they also burned me CD's to listen to. I discovered a lot of bands that I still listen to and patronize because of my friends recommendations. However, their recommendations alone would probably only have persuaded me to listen to a fraction of the music that I ended up liking. The real thing that pushed me over the edge was the fact that I could try out what they were recommending to me. I didn't have to go out and find it and I didn't have to risk spending the money on something I might not like.

As a marketer, the goal is to win over the majority with your product. The way you win over the majority is by making your product remarkable so that the early adopters will want to talk about your product. If you want your salesmen, the early adopters, to do a good job selling your product you have to equip them with the right tools. Someone is not going to buy a $500 dollar license for software or spend 3 hours filling out forms just to use a product based on another persons recommendation. The barrier is too high. Make it easy for your salesmen. Give them the CD's to hand out. Upload your videos to YouTube so they are easy to link to. Only ask for the bare minimum for someone to register on your site. When you make it easier for your salesman to make the sale, you will benefit.
