When I was in elementary school we had a special speaker come. He was a story teller who had an odd trait. He would repeat everything he said three times. Finally, he explained this to us. He said the first time was so that we would hear it, the second time was so we would listen, and the third was so that we would remember it. He repeated the explanation three times and needless to say, I never forgot it.

Marketers have the same sort of goal as that story teller. They want you to remember what they tell you so that you will use that information when you make a purchase. It used to be true that they could do that directly through advertisements. That is no longer the case, since very few people let a marketer get past the hearing stage. Seth Godin's concept of [permission marketing][1] is one example of a way to bridge the gap from hearing to listening and the [purple cow][2] is a great way to get that permission. The next gap is covered by the [idea virus][3] of your purple cow.

You as a marketer are not the person who will make people remember your product. Direct advertisements do __not__ work. The only thing you can do is get people to listen. Once you have done that, the people who have listened will make others remember for you.
